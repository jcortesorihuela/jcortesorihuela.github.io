      We show that the inconsistency of the Two-Sample Two-Stage Least Squares (TSTSLS) Intergenerational
Earnings Elasticity (IGE) estimator is a two-way prediction problem involving
the replication of (i) the variance of unobserved parental earnings, and (ii) the endogeneity of
unobserved parental earnings in the equation of children’s earnings. Concretely,we showthat
the TSTSLS estimator asymptotically recovers the OLS IGE when the first-stage R-squared, i.e., the
share of explained variance of parental earnings, equals the share of explained endogeneity
of parental earnings in the child’s earnings equation. This condition leads to two notable
outcomes with respect to previous findings in the literature: (i) perfect prediction of parental
earnings is a specific instance of our condition, indicating that consistency can be attained
even when parental earnings are predicted imperfectly and (ii) exogenous instruments alone
are insufficient to guarantee asymptotic equivalence between TSTSLS and OLS IGE estimates.
Furthermore, our condition suggests that strong first-stage instruments might amplify
TSTSLS bias if they are also strongly endogenous in the child’s earnings equation. This last
result provides a formal criterion for choosing first-stage predictors under the assumption that
TSTSLS IGE estimates exhibit upward bias. Additionally, we theoretically study the biases
of the two-sample stochastic multiple imputation and cell multiple imputation (MI) procedures,
identifying conditions under which MI procedures outperform the traditional TSTSLS
estimator. Finally, we validate our results through an empirical Monte Carlo exercise using
administrative data from the Chilean formal private sector.

      This paper provides the first estimates of intergenerational earnings mobility in Chile
using administrative data linking parents’ and children’s earnings from the formal private
sector. We calculate mobility measures across the earnings distribution, revealing
high mobility in the bottom 80% and 65% of the parents’ and children’s distribution,
respectively. However, we observe significant persistence in the upper tail of
the earnings distribution. Additionally, we identify notable gender heterogeneities in
these mobility patterns. Specifically, the intergenerational mobility gender gap shows
a nonlinear relationship with respect to parental earnings. Furthermore, we find that
differences in mobility between the upper tail of the earnings distribution and the rest
of the population are more pronounced for daughters than for sons. These findings
suggest that the dynamics of gender-based mobility at the upper tail of the earnings
distribution differ from those observed in the rest of the population.

      This paper revisits the Two-Sample Two-Stage Least Squares (TSTSLS) method, commonly used to estimate intergenerational mobility measures
        without linked parent-child earnings data. First, we study the TSTSLS intergenerational earnings elasticity (IGE) by decomposing it into
        the IGE estimated via OLS with linked parent-child earnings data, a projection bias, and a variance bias. We propose a parsimonious
        procedure, the doubly corrected TSTSLS (DC-TSTSLS), to i) eliminate the variance bias and ii) reduce the prediction bias. Our method provides
        a lower bound for the IGE estimate via OLS with linked earnings data. Second, we formally study the rank-rank correlation estimated through
        TSTSLS by decomposing the estimator into the rank-rank correlation estimated through OLS with linked data and a projection bias. We deliver
        analytical conditions for when this estimate is a lower-bound of the OLS rank-rank correlation estimated using linked data. Finally,
        we use parent-child linked administrative data from a developing country to test our lower-bound method through an empirical Monte Carlo approach,
        confirming its validity. Our doubly corrected IGE and rank-rank TSTSLS estimators are informative lower bounds of their respective OLS
        intergenerational mobility estimates computed using linked data. Our results suggest that the following practices should be implemented
        when the TSTSLS method is used to estimate intergenerational mobility measures: i) report the estimates of the rank-rank correlation computed
        through TSTSLS, and ii) implement our lower-bound methodology when facing data constraints, (i.e., only a few controls are available to impute parental earnings).

      <div id="abstractjoei" class="hidden">
        This paper studies the relationship between intergenerational economic persistence and preferences
        for the provision of public goods. Specifically, we develop a simple theoretical model in which a
        public good is financed through proportional taxation, and that predicts a lower provision of public
        goods given an increase in the intergenerational earnings elasticity (IGE), which is widely recognized
        as a measure of the degree of economic persistence from one generation to the next in society. We test
        this model empirically using the results of the 2020 Chilean national plebiscite, which asked about
        the replacement of the standing constitution by a new one that would potentially expand the role of
        the state in the provision of public goods. Our estimates suggest the existence of a positive association
        between the IGE and the share of the vote against a new constitution, even after controlling for median
        income and income inequality. These findings are consistent with our model and suggest that sectors of
        society that exhibit higher degrees of economic persistence also show greater reluctance towards
        redistributive policies that increase public goods provision.

        We estimate spatially disaggregated measures of intergenerational mobility in Chile through
        an administrative dataset linking child’s and their parent’s earnings from the formal private
        labour sector. We report remarkable heterogeneity as we find higher and lower upward mobility 
        in mining and agricultural regions, respectively, corroborating Connolly et al. (2019) with 
        the distinction that Chile is a unitary form of government, implying that factors other than 
        institutional differences shape mobility.
